# Solving the 2D advection equation

(1) RK_1---->SSPRK(5,4) scheme with forward Euler time step corresponds to Figure 4 (Top row) in the manuscript;

(2) RK_2---->SSPRK(5,4) scheme with large time step corresponds to Figure 4 (Second row) in the manuscript;

(3) pRK---->pRK(5,4) scheme corresponds to Figure 4 (Third row) in the manuscript;

(4) pRRK---->pRRK(5,4) scheme corresponds to Figure 4 (Bottom row) in the manuscript.
